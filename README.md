# VR-Minigolf

## About this repository
Welcome to VR Minigolf!!! VR Minigolf is a small title that I'm working on with the plans to publish for FREE for steamVR and (potentially) standalone to Quest 2!!

The primary goal for this project is to learn the development cycle for publishing games from pre-production all the way to post-production. I plan on following the traditional development cycle utilising [HackNPlan](https://www.hacknplan.com.au) using the AGILE development process.

A lot of progress reports will be posted on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/attila-toth-7b6b621ab/) which will have small snippets and devlogs that will explain and talk more about my personal development travels and struggles.

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND!!!
This project is designed for the intention to learn how the game development cycle works, this is a passion project and I am not making anything off of this. This is purely for enjoyment and for my education!!!!

For any questions and/or how to contribute to the project, feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/attila-toth-7b6b621ab/) Official start date of project 17/07/2024.
